## Sehar Nisar | Data Science | Python Developer | AI/ML | LLMs

I’m a Data Science graduate from Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT) with a strong passion for AI, large language models (LLMs), and intelligent system design. I specialize in building LLM-based chatbots, multi-agent architectures, RAG-powered applications, and computer vision pipelines. My work combines clean backend development with practical applications of deep learning and cloud deployment tools.
